what I've done:
- created a virtual environment for windows users maned "vendata" using `python -m venv vendata`
- installed a new packages named "scipy" using `pip install scipy`
- created a new class named "MannWhitney.py"  within project/tests


Instructions
on windows:
 1. pull the project from the branch develop  using `git pull origin develop`
 2. run `venv\Scripts\activate` from within the project root directory to activate the virtual environment

 on linux:
  1. one might create  a virtual environment for linux named "vendataL" using `python3 -m venv vendataL` fron within the run directory of the project
  2.  run `source venv/bin/activate` from within the project root directory to activate the virtual envrironment

What I'm doing:

- implementing the MannWhitney test and of course providing testvalues for that test.
